# Kotlin
Scripts and Programs with Kotlin Language

Remember you need install Java and System Path Variables in your OS.
Then Kotlin Scripts are saved in .kt files, so for execute in your Machine you'll need convert it into a java .jar file
maybe in the future this won't be needed.
Wherever the Kotlin's command to conversion is:

kotlinc example.kt -include-runtime -d example.jar

Note: I'll put all knowledge I acquired in my way x3
